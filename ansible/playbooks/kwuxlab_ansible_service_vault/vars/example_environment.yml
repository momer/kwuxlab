# In production, this should be a *new* token, and NOT the master token used for
# the initial bootstrapping of Consul's ACL configuration.
#
# Also note, that this is a sensitive value; an example UUID is provided below
# for demonstration purposes, allowing for consistent/tangible examples
# that can be followed across repositories.
